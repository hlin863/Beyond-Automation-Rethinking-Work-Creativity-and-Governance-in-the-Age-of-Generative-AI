Beyond Automation: Rethinking Work, Creativity, and Governance in the Age of Generative AI
Haocheng Lin (2025, revised 2026)

The project examines how generative artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping work, creativity, and economic security in ways that extend beyond conventional automation and productivity narratives. It develops an <b>Inclusive AI Governance Framework</b> 
that integrates labour economics, sectoral diffusion, policy analysis, and qualitative discourse critique.

The repository serves as a <b>research artefact and reference implementation</b> for the conceptual framework, empirical modelling logic, and governance principles discussed in the paper.
